The idea behind this repository is to create word clouds by scraping Twitter data: _awesome_ ones!
We will create word clouds related to stocks of famous companies; this method however can be applied to many more areas.

## 🗂 Contents
There are two notebooks containing examples for how to create the word clouds and two data folders:
1. `Scraping Twitter Data with Twint`: obtain Twitter data related to a certain topic
2. `Creating Word Cloud`: clean up scraped data and create word clouds applying masks
3. `data/`: contains scraped data from Twitter related to stocks in 2020
4. `images/`: contains logos (for applying masks) and obtained images

## ⚙️ Instructions
We scrape data from Twitter by using `Twint` which allows us to create datasets without the need of API keys. Please follow these instructions to make it work properly:
1. https://github.com/twintproject/twint/issues/1165
